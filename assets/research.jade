					:markdown
						I am an assistant professor at Politecnico di Milano and I have worked in processor architecture 
						research and development for one of the top semiconductor companies in the world.

						I am currently interested in parallel and asynchronous programming, 
						with emphasis on parallelism exploitation, domain specific constructs
						graphical user interfaces and scripting languages for the web.

						Troughout the years at Politecnico, I discovered that I love teaching by making students 
						passionate about computer engineering. I like matching conventional methods for teaching with 
						novel technology such as live-coding, program simulation and information graphics.
